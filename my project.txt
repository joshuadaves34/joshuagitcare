There are basic principles - beliefs, that all people have rights, abilities and freedom of choice. The carer needs to be aware of these principles and ensure to keep them in mind when assisting clients. Such principles include the following:

INDEPENDENCE: Each person has the freedom to direct oneâ€™s own life and be able to do things for oneself when possible. Each person can choose what to do and when to do it; carers should not dictate to clients what to do.

DIGNITY: Each person is an individual. Each person needs respect and privacy and should be treated respectfully. When people need assistance, they still need to feel they are valued and in control of their own lives, as much as possible.
